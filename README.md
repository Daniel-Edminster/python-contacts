=======Contact Manager=======

=============================
```

Pretty self-explanatory. 

`1. Add a new Contact` prompts for a first name, last name, and 10 digit phone number. Any tomfoolery is regexâ€™d out by default, number format is 10 digit US for now.

`2. Update existing Contact` prompts for a contact search (ID, first name, last name, or number), will provide you a list of matches and allow you to edit the properties of a contact by providing its ID. 

`3. Delete a Contact` allows deletion of contact by supplying its ID.

`4. List all Contacts` prints every contact in the database to the command line, chronologically.

`5. Search for Contacts` prompts for a contact search (ID, first name, last name, or number), will provide you a list of matches. 

`6. Export Contacts as VCF` will export every contact in the database as a valid, VCF 3.0 file with the naming convention: `id-first_name-last_name.vcf` in the `lib` directory.

`7. Exit this Program` Deletes your system32 and crashes python. But really just exits the program.
